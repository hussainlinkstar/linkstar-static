Employers acknowledge that the nature and\r\n                        frequency of any work performed by a Candidate on their behalf could result in the Candidate\r\n                        being classified as an employee of the Employer. If Candidates or Employers have any questions\r\n                        about their legal rights and duties, they should seek independent legal advice. To the extent\r\n                        that Employers receive any contact or personal information regarding any Candidate, such\r\n                        information must be used in compliance with applicable laws and for no other purpose whatsoever.\r\n                        We accept no liability in relation to the use or storage of personal data by any Employer.\r\n                      </li>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        Each active Employer account has a finite number of Credits allocated to their account.\r\n                      </li>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        Each Credit unlocks one Candidate’s contact details or uploaded documents such as CV.\r\n                      </li>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        The number of Credits allocated to each active Employer account is at the sole discretion of the\r\n                        Business and any duly appointed account manager or representative, in line with the terms of any\r\n                        agreed Employer proposal or contract.\r\n                      </li>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        Credits are automatically added to Employer accounts each month until account expiry.\r\n                      </li>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        At its sole discretion, the Business may provide additional Credits to any Employer account upon\r\n                        receiving reasonable written request, presuming this request not be deemed for use in any\r\n                        purpose other than engaging a high volume of Candidates for legitimate Career Opportunities.\r\n                      </li>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        We have no involvement in the relationship between Candidates and Employers and hence we shall\r\n                        have no responsibility in relation to resolving any disputes between Candidates and/or Employers\r\n                        related to or arising out of their use of the Website.\r\n                      </li>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        Visa and Mastercard in AED and USD will be accepted for payment.\r\n                      </li>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        We will not trade with or provide any Services or customer support to OFAC and sanctioned\r\n                        countries.\r\n                      </li>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        Cardholder must retain a copy of transaction records and Merchant policies and rules.\r\n                      </li>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        You will receive a confirmation of successful payment by email (to the email address that was\r\n                        provided during payment).
